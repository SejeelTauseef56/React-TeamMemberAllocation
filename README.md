## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- https://replit.com/@SejeelTauseef1/Team-Member-Allocation?v=1
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

Team Member Allocation is a web-based application built using React js which allows you to easily assign employees to different teams and view their team members. With this application, you can create new teams and assign employees to them, or move existing employees between teams. You can also view the full list of employees for each team, allowing you to quickly see who is on each team and make adjustments as needed. This project is perfect for managers or team leaders who need a simple way to manage their team allocations and keep track of their employees.
